I have not been very lucky in my attempts to recover code from the few surviving old cassettes and disks I have. Therefore everything in this section has been lifted from the various links. I'd like to comb through the code and write little summaries of the programs and create a little index. If you try some of these, please send me your comments.

By the way, the programs below are in cassette-dump format, meaning that each line ends with a `<CR>` and several nulls. This is reccomended if you plan to encode the files for cassette input, or upload via the serial port, since BASIC needs a few moments to digest each input line. If you wish to remove the nulls (for example, to edit under Unix/Linux or DOS), you can use the 'tr' command, standard on unix/linux, and available for DOS/win. The following removes nulls and CRs:

```
tr -d '\000\015' < ASM.BAS >tmp
```

or

```
for i in *; do tr -d '\000\015' < $i >tmp; mv tmp $i; done
```
