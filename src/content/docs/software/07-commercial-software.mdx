## Compilers and Development Tools

| Application | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| [FBASIC 1.0 manual](/software/fbasic/fbasic_v1.0.pdf) | FBASIC Version 1.0 manual.<br/>Thanks so much to forum member John for contributing these scans!! |
| [FBASIC 1.12 disk image](/software/fbasic/fbasic1.img)<br/>[FBASIC 1.1 manual](/software/fbasic/fbasic_v1.1.pdf)<br/>[FBASIC 1.1 notes](/software/fbasic/fbasic_release_notes_v1.1.pdf) | FBASIC V1.12. 8" disk image for C2/4/8. Thanks so much to forum member John!!<br/><br/>FBASIC is a compiler for a subset of Microsoft BASIC. Some of the missing features are:<br/>• Only 1-D arrays (so 2D arrays must include additional row / column offset calculation)<br/>• No string manipulation functions (MID#, RIGHT$, LEFT$, STR$/VAL, etc.)<br/>• Only unsigned 16-bit integer variables.<br/>• No floating point and no transcendental functions (sin/cos/tan/exp/log)<br/>• No sgn function, irrelevant for unsigned vars<br/>• new/run/stop/exit irrelevant, not implemented<br/>• no USR(X), but there is another mechanism for calling machine code<br/>• No STEP in FOR/NEXT loop<br/>• No garbage collection of strings.<br/><br/>Some extensions are:<br/>• Direct access to 6502 registers in the code; directly transfer between registers and variables<br/>• Directly GOSUB to machine language routines, so no need for USR(X)<br/>• WHILE / WEND loop construct<br/>• Location of arrays can be specified at time of declaration<br/><br/>Version 1.1 adds: Improved INPUT, adds SPC, TAB, POS functions, adds MOD and RND functions, adds ON/GOTO, compiler can understand disk drive specifier (A:/B:). Adds several compiled versions of OS65D utilities. Thanks to John!! |
| [FigFORTH OS65U manual](/software/figforth-65u/figFORTH_OS65U.pdf) | Intro section of the manual for a version of Fig Forth for OS65U, ported by Software Consultants (Memphis, TN). Thanks to John for the contribution!! |
| [Aardvark Tiny Compiler v1.3](/software/aardvark/TinyCompiler_1.3.pdf) | Version 1.3 of the Aardvark Tiny BASIC Compiler. Manual and BASIC Source code listing. Limited BASIC subset (cannot compile itself.) Many thanks to Steve!! |
| [Beta65 Manual](/manuals/beta65.pdf) | Manual for the Beta65 compiler. |
| [Pegasus A/65 Assembler](/software/pegasus/pegasus_a65.pdf) | Manual for the Pegasus A/65 two-pass assembler |

## Word Processing


| Application | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| [WP6502 v1.3 Manual](/software/wp6502/wp6502_v1.3_manual.pdf)<br/>[WP6502 disassembly](/software/wp6502/wp6502_v1.3_disassembly.pdf) | Word Processing application by Duo Quong Fok Lok Sow. I've also included a scan of a disassembled version. This appears to be an in-progress project, with handwritten notes on the listing. Also, check out this Nov 2, 1981 [InfoWorld review](/software/wp6502/wp6502_review_infoworld.pdf) |
| [WP-2 image, C2/4/8 5.25"](/software/wp2/WP2.zip)<br/>[WP-2 manual](/software/wp2/wp2-manual.pdf) | WP2, the OSI word processor offering. This disk image was provided by Mike, constructed from a disk image provided by Mark Spankus. Thanks Mike and Mark! |
| [WP-3 manual](/software/wp3/wp3-manual.pdf) | WP3, the next generation OSI word processor offering. |
