| [C1P-OS65D33-mike.zip](/disk_images/C1P-OS65D33-mike.zip) | C1P | 8" | File: C1P_OS65D338_1.65U an 8" image for winOSI or dump to your OSI -C1P. Contributed by Mike.<br/><br/>"This is the same as the OS65D338_1.65U image for the C2/C4 but with the appropriate changes for the C1P (standard video) ie inverted keyboard,screen format and ACIA locations. This image has been constructed using Debug on the PC from the 5.25 image supplied with the winOSI emulator. All the necessary conversion changes required for track and sector layout, buffer sizes, DOS code, BASIC code, Bexec*, BASIC utilites and macine code utilities etc have been made. It includes some bug fixes and will work with the original and Cegmon monitors. Also included are two utilities from Tutorial disk 2 and the demo data file handling programs from the OSI manual. Disclaimer: I had only the info available from the OSI manual to go by as far as the BASIC utility changes and track layout went. The other changes I discovered myself during many hours coding. I have given the image a reasonable test using the winOSI emulator and it works fine to date."<br/><br/>If you find any bugs or have comments please [post here](http://osiweb.org/osiforum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=91#p557)<br/><br/>( winOSI : Cegmon_C1.rom or SYN600.

| [C4P-OS65D33-mike.zip](/disk_images/C4P-OS65D33-mike.zip) | C4P | 8" | Image file: OS65D338_1.65U, an 8" image for winOSI or dump to your OSI C2/4/8P. Contributed by Mike:<br/><br/>"This image has been constructed using Debug on the PC from the 5.25 image supplied with the winOSI emulator. Intended for dumping this down to OSI via RS232 and reconstructing a bootable disk. It also gives us an 8" image for the winOSI emulator !
