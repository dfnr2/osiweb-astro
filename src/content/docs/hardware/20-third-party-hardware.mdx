Third-party companies created various expansion boards and upgrades for OSI computers. These boards provided additional functionality and capabilities beyond the standard OSI offerings.

| Board | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [D&N MEM-CM9](/manuals/DN_MEM_CM9.pdf) | D & N Products MEM-CM9 24K RAM (as 48 2114 chips) and OSI-compatible floppy controller card. This is equivalent to an OSI 527 card and a 470 card in a single slot. The RAM is addressable as an 8K block and a 16K block, which can be placed anywhere in the 64K memory space, and also can be assigned a RAM segment withing a multiple-64K memory space for a multi-user environment.

| [D & N 8K](/manuals/DN_8K_RAM.pdf) | 8K RAM board. |
| CxP ([Front](/misc/CxP_Front.jpg), [Back](/misc/CxP_Back.jpg)) | CxP 16-bit OSI next-generation upgrade board, based on the WDC 65c802/65c816 processor. Pictures courtesy of Scott Larson. See Forum thread [here](http://osiweb.org/osiforum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=151). Described in detail in [Peek(65) V8 N1&2](/Peek65/Peek65_V8N1and2-01-02_1987.pdf). Perhaps the only surviving speciment? |
| [Lomas Color board](/manuals/Lomas_color.pdf) | Lomas Data Products enhanced replacement for the OSI 540B color video board, providing OSI compatibility with enhanced color capability and super-hi-resolution capability with up to 512x512 pixels in 16 colors. Contributed by Andre. Thanks! |
| [Lomas Thunder 186](/manuals/Lomas_Thunder_186_manual.pdf) | Lomas Data Products Thunder 186 80186-based board providing fast MS-DOS operation in the OSI bus. Contributed by Andre. Thanks! |
| [Micro-Craft 32K](/manuals/Micro-Craft_32K_RAMboard.pdf) | Micro-Craft 32K RAM board. (Thanks to Steve Gray for the contribution.) |
| [RDS PCB-3](/manuals/RDS_PCB-3.pdf) | RDS (River Data Systems) multi-function (64K RAM, real-time-clock, serial I/O, parallel I/O) card for the OSI bus. |
