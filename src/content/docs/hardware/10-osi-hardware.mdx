The most comprehensive listing of OSI boards, with variants and manuals, is the [OSI Board Catalog](http://osi.marks-lab.com/boards/boards.html) at [Mark's Lab](http://osi.marks-lab.com/). Definitely check the site out. I have collected schematics of several boards here, many from my own scans, several contributed by Mark, and several contributed by other kind OSI enthusiasts. Thanks so much to those who have contributed. I'm always looking out for more high-quality scans to archive here. Also, see Mark Spankus' [OSI board catalog](http://osi.marks-lab.com/boards/boards.html) for more information and nice photos of many of these boards.

| Board | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [300](/manuals/OSI_300.pdf) | Original OSI product. A 6502 trainer with 128 bytes of RAM, and binary switch programming, with two input lines and a 1-bit output latch. Designed as a learning tool, the manual is essentially a comprehensive introduction to bare-metal 6502 programming. Do check it out. Much thanks to Bill Dromgoole for the contribution! |
| [400](/manuals/OSI_400.pdf) | OSI called this one the "Superboard." (The later OSI 600/C1 with video onboard was the Superboard II). A single board computer which could accept either a 6502, 6501, or 6800 as the CPU, with 1K RAM(eight 2102), 512 bytes EPROM/PROM (two 1702A, serial I/O (6850 ACIA), and a 40-pin user discretionary IC spot for a PIA, 6530, or any other chip, and an OSI 48-pin bus interface. A fully usable single board computer along the lines of KIM/SYM, without the keypad, with the bus expansion built in. Thanks to Bill Dromgoole! |
| [420C](/manuals/OSI_420-C.pdf) | 4K x 8- or optionally 12- bit static memory board, with (optional switched) battery backup. Courtesy of Bill Dromgoole. |
| [430B](/manuals/OSI_430B.pdf) | Super I/O board. 8 Parallel IO, UART Serial IO, RS232 / Cassette interface, 1 ADC w 8-channel multiplexer, 2 DAC, Z-unblank one-shot, fast pulse output. Courtesy of Bill Dromgoole. |
| [440](/manuals/OSI_440_Video_Graphics.pdf) | Early OSI video card,1K RAM, 32 x 32 characters, similar to C1P video. Can use a dedicated 420 memory card for 128 x 128 pixel graphics. Courtesy of Bill Dromgoole. |
| [470 single](/manuals/470.pdf) / [470 all](/manuals/OSI-470-centronics.pdf) | Disk controller card. The interface contained a 6820 PIA for control lines, and a 6850 ACIA to read and write data to the disk. The board requires separated data/clock signals, provided by several 8" drives, but very few 5.25" drives. The MPI B-51 drive was the standard OSI mini-floppy, and held 40 tracks with 2k per track. There were many articles in PEEK(65) on how to improve the disk interface, build data separators, etc. Some of these are in the scan section. Also, the PIA could be populated alone, for use as a parallel I/O card. The second set of schematics showing the 470 configured as a single or dual sided floppy interfacee, and as a centronics interface, was contributed by Bill Dromgoole.<br/><br/>OSI 470 gerber files on github: [OSI_470.zip](https://github.com/osiweb/Hardware/raw/master/repro/OSI_470/production-package/OSI_470.zip) |

| [500](/manuals/OSI_500.pdf) | 6502-based CPU with on-board 8K BASIC-in-ROM, ROM monitor in 3 x 1702 EPROMS (256 bytes each), 4K RAM as 16 x 2102 chips, 6850-based serial port with 20-ma current loop or RS-232 interface; 6820-based parallel port. Courtesy of Bill Dromgoole. |
| [502](/manuals/502.pdf) | Successor to the 500 board. 6502-based CPU with on-board 8K BASIC-in-ROM, 2K ROM monitor (with a complex addressing scheme to allow physical remapping of 256-byte ROM pages, to maintain compatibility with the 1702-based monitor code from the 500 board), 8K RAM as 16 x 2114 chips, 6850-based serial port with audio cassete, 20 ma current loop, or RS-232 interface. The parallel interface was dropped in this version.<br/><br/>OSI 502 Gerber files on github: [OSI_502.zip](https://github.com/osiweb/Hardware/raw/master/repro/OSI_502/production-package/OSI_502.zip)<br/>Jeff Ferguson's Build guide and log (with BOM) on Github: [502_Assembly_Instructions_and_Log.pdf](https://github.com/osiweb/Hardware/raw/master/repro/OSI_502/502_Assembly_Instructions_and_Log.pdf) |
| [505 Rev A](/manuals/505_RevA.pdf) / [505 Rev B](/manuals/505.pdf) | Like the 502, but for disk-based systems. Omits the BASIC-in-ROM and the KCS cassette interface, but adds a 470-equivalent floppy interface. Thanks to Bill Dromgoole for the high-res scan!<br/><br/>OSI 505 gerber files on github: [OSI_505.zip](https://github.com/osiweb/Hardware/raw/master/repro/OSI_505/production-package/OSI_505.zip) |
| [510](/manuals/OSI-510-revc.pdf) | Triple CPU board used in the C3 series. Contains software selectable 6502, Z80, and a 6800. The Z80 can run OSI's port of CP/M. Scan by Bill Dromgoole. |
| [512](/manuals/OSI-512.pdf) | OSI 512 board. Not sure what this is for. It seems to be some kind of FSK encoder that takes a clocked data stream and turns it into bursts of 4.7 MHz (mark) or 6.5 MHz (space). Perhaps this is part of the RF home control system? Any info is welcome. Contributed by Bill D. |
| [520 Rev C](/manuals/OSI-520-revc.pdf) | 16K Static RAM board based on the SEMI 4200 4096 x 1 static RAM chip. Contributed by Bill D. Thanks! |
| [522](/manuals/OSI-522.pdf) | 48K static RAM chip, based on the GTE 8104 1024 x 8 static RAM chip. Thanks to Bill D. |
| [525](/manuals/OSI_525.pdf) | Dual port static RAM board. (Thanks to Jonathan for the contribution.) |
| [527](/manuals/527_2.pdf) | 24K RAM board. With forty-eight 2114 chips, this board required it's own power supply, separate from the main supply. |
| [535](/manuals/OSI-535.pdf) | 48K dynamic RAM board based on the 4116 16k x 1 dynamic RAM and the [Intel 3242 dynamic RAM controller chip](/manuals/Intel-3242-dram-controller.pdf). Thanks to Bill D. for the scan! |
| [540A](/manuals/540A.pdf) | Second-generation video board with 64x32 characters and guard bands (First generation was the 440, with 32x32 characters and no guard bands, similar to the circuit in the Superboard/Challenger I). OSIers loved this card because it was so hackable. |
| [540 rev B](/manuals/OSI-540B.pdf) | Design similar to the 540A, but adds 4-bits of color. Thanks to Steve Gray for the hi-res scan! Parts layout (last page) contributed by Bill D.<br/><br/>OSI 540B gerber files on github: [OSI_540B.zip](https://github.com/osiweb/Hardware/raw/master/repro/OSI_540B/production-package/OSI_540B.zip) |
| [541 pic](/manuals/541/OSI541top_zps73926f02.JPG) / [541 schematic](/manuals/541/541_schematic1.pdf) / [541 layout](/manuals/541/541_Layout.pdf) / [541 info](/misc/OSI_541.pdf) | This is a High-resolution add-on offered by MA/COM as an add-on for systems with the 540B board, and as part of the C-100 system (which seems to be an upgraded C4P with high-res graphics option.) This info was supplied by Jeff Ferguson, who got one of these boards in his C4P, and was kind enough to supply high-res photos, and to reverse-engineer the schematics. Any addition info is certainly welcome. |
| [542 rev B](/manuals/542B.pdf) / [542 rev C](/manuals/OSI-542-revc.pdf) | Keyboard to accompany the 540B. Thanks to Steve Gray for the hi-res Rev B scan, and Bill D. for the Rev C scan! |
| [550](/manuals/OSI_550.pdf) | 16 port serial board (for multiuser systems) (Thanks to Jonathan for the contribution.) |
| [555](/manuals/OSI-555.pdf) / [Pics](/manuals/OSI-555_board_images.pdf) | "Jungle Board" multi-function RAM+I/O board. I believe this was designed for the C3 multi-user and CPM systems. It contains 8K RAM in two blocks, 4 Serial ports, a "Network Node Interface" for multi-user systems, Centronics and NEC-wordprocessor compatible parallel interfaces. |
| [560Z](/manuals/OSI560Z.pdf) | "Processor Lab" board. This unique and remarkable board contains a Z80 and intersil 6100, with control of the 6100 and Z-80 chips by the host 6502, which can emulate I/O and other instructions to provide full PDP-8 emulation, Z-80 I/O compatibility, 8080 compatibility, etc. The 6202 assembly source code for PDP-8 IOT emulation, and Z80 I/O emulation is [here](/manuals/560Z_software_listing.pdf).

| 600 | Sold as the "superboard II", or with a case and power supply as the Challenger I. This was a single board system incorporating a built-in keyboard, 8K BASIC-in-ROM, 2K ROM monitor (without the complex remapping scheme), 8K 2114 RAM, 32x32 char video with 1K 2114 RAM (similar to the 440 card), and a serial port with audio cassette or RS-232 capabilities. Hook up a power supply and monitor, and this is a complete computer system, like an Apple II, but for $279. |
