| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [OSI App Note #1](/manuals/OSI_appnote_1.pdf) | Discusses adding a 6530 with the TIM monitor to the OSI 400 Board. Courtesy of Bill Dromgoole. |
| [OSI App Note #2](/manuals/OSI_appnote_2.pdf) | Discusses OSI system expansion. This is aimed at the 400 board, but applies to the later 500 series boards as well, and to expansion for the 600 board. It discusses memory map, the OSI 48-line bus, the 480 backplane, and more. This is also the manual for the 480 backplane board used in C2-8P and C3 systems. Courtesy of Bill Dromgoole. |
| [OSI App Note #3](/manuals/OSI_appnote_3.pdf) | Series 400 construction hints (applies to all OSI boards.) |
| [OSI App Note #4A](/manuals/OSI_appnote_4a.pdf) | 6502 Clock circuits |
| [Intersil App Note: IM6100 CMOS Processor Memory Extension](/appnotes/IM6100_CMOS_Processor_Memory_Extension.pdf) | Intersil App Note explaining how to implement the 32K memory extension for the IM6100 processor, which is used in the 460Z/560Z boards for PDP-8 emulation |
| [Intersil App Note: ROM based Subroutine Calls with the IM6100](/appnotes/ROM_Based_Subroutine_Calls_With_the_IM6100.pdf) | Intersil App Note explaining techniques for calling ROM subroutines for the IM6100 processor.  The IM6100, like the PDP-8, expects to store the return address in the first memory location of the called routine.  This note explores techniques to wrap the ROM routines with RAM-based code to handle the return address. |
