| [OSI May 1976 Catalog](/ads_and_catalogs/OSI_May_1976_Catalog.pdf) | Contributed by Bill Dromgoole. This is a very early catalog (The first OSI magazine ad of which I'm aware is from Feb 1976.) Includes the OSI 300 trainer, OSI 400 board, 410 board, 440 board, and the 480 backplane (shown interfaced to a Kim-1!) |
| [OSI Winter 1976 Catalog](/ads_and_catalogs/OSI_1976_Winter_Catalog.pdf) | Introduces the Challenger line, based on 400-series boards. The 470 floppy system appears here, as does the 460Z with the 6100 and Z80, plus a spot for another microprocessor of your choice. Thanks to Bill Dromgoole! |
| [OSI Spring 1978 Catalog](/ads_and_catalogs/OSI_spring_1978_catalog.pdf) | OSI spring 1978 catalog: C3 systems including 74MB winchester. C2 systems. Still offered the 500 CPU and the 440 video board. No superboard or C1. |
