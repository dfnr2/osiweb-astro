# Welcome

Welcome to OSIWeb.org, a repository for OSI documentation, literature, software,
thoughts, tips, tricks, hacks, and community knowledge.

In the 1970s, personal computers were brand-new—and choosing one felt as
personal as choosing a car. Among the earliest makers of complete systems was a
small company called Ohio Scientific (OSI). They started with bare boards and
hobbyist kits and later moved into fully built, integrated machines.

I bought my C2-4P used in 1979 after spending a couple of years haunting
computer stores and drooling over PETs, Apples, and the OSI Challengers (and
glossy ads for the IMSAI, SOL, and more). The Challengers were especially
hackable: roomy layouts, modular design, and a straightforward architecture.
Plenty of sites cover the full history.

Around 2001, I dug out my old C2-4P, removed some mods held in place by a tangle
or blue wires, repaired a bunch of traces, and brought it back to the familiar
`C/W/M?` prompt. I then started scanning materials and posting it on this site,
with the help of the Netscape built-in editor.

## Troubleshooting your OSI

**OSI not working? <img src="/images/dont-panic.svg" alt="Don't Panic" style="height: 64px; width: auto; display: inline; vertical-align: middle;" /> Don't panic.**

You may be here because you have pulled your old OSI from the closet, acquired
one on eBay, or built a replica, and now you need to get it working.

These machines are simple, understandable, and generally fixable with a little
patience. OSI owners have always been a hands-on bunch, spending late nights
chasing gremlins, adding hardware mods, and interfacing with “foreign” gear.

**Start here:**

- An article from *Peek(65)*, Vol. 6, Issue 11.
- The **SAMS manuals** if you have a C1, C2, C4, C8, Superboard, or similar system (see **Manuals** below).
- Prof. Mark Csele’s illustrated debugging notes (linked below).
- The **Tips & Tricks** section here and the OSIweb forums.
- Broader communities: the classiccmp cctalk list at [classiccmp.org](http://www.classiccmp.org) and the Vintage Computer Federation forums at [vcfed.org](https://forum.vcfed.org).

If you’re stuck, post on the forums—or reach out directly.

## Contribute

If you have OSI hardware you’re not motivated to maintain, or software/documentation you’d like to share, consider contributing it to the archive so others can benefit.

### WISH LIST:

I welcome contributions, especially of software and scanned (or paper) manuals, stories, tips, tricks, hacks, and other info. I am also interested in working and non-working OSI hardware, either photos or the real thing. I am particularly interested in any information on the following:

- **Documentation or software for the Generic Computer Products Color-Plus card**

Also, any information about, or working or non-working specimens of the following:

- **OSI 460Z card**
- **Any Mittendorf engineering hi-res kits, or similar Aardvark or other video mods for the C2/4 or for the C1/superboard**

I'd love to hear from any other OSI'ers. Please check out the **[Forums](/forum)** section of the archive, and post any comments, corrections, or memories for all of us to enjoy! You can also email me privately via the Forums section.

## Contact

You can reach me directly at my osiweb.org address (dave, of course). Or register on the forums and send a private message or email from there.
