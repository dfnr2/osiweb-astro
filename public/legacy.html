    <p><br />
      In the 70&#39;s, personal computers were a fresh idea.&nbsp; Your choice of computer was as much an individual expression as your choice of car.&nbsp; One of the earliest makers of complete computer systems was a small company called Ohio Scientific.&nbsp; They specialized in bare boards and kits for hobbyists, later focusing on fully built, integrated systems.&nbsp; I bought my C2-4P used in 1979, after hanging out at computer stores and drooling over PET, Apple, and the OSI challengers (and over glossy ads for the IMSAI, SOL, etc.) for a couple of years.&nbsp; The Challengers were perhaps the most conducive to hacking because of their spacious layout, modular design, and simple architecture.&nbsp; There are other sites that recount the history of these machines and the company that made them (see the links section.)&nbsp; Recently, I dug out my old C2, removed lots of blue wires, restored many traces (I would like to add a hacks page later) and got my machine back to the familiar C/W/M? prompt.<br />
      <br />
      This archive is a repository for OSI thoughts, tips, tricks, hacks, literature and software.&nbsp; I&#39;m attempting to arrange it in as sane a fashion as possible.</p>

    <p><font size="5"><strong>Your OSI doesn&#39;t work?&nbsp; Don&#39;t panic. . .</strong></font></p>

    <p><span><span style="font-weight: bold">You can almost certainly fix your machine, perhaps with a bit of help.&nbsp; </span>Even back in the day, OSI owners have traditionally, as a group, been familiar with the guts of our machines, and most have spent many a late hour chasing down bugs, hacking in hardware mods, and intefacing with foreign objects.&nbsp; And OSI machines are generally simple to understand and (usually) to fix.</span></p>

    <p><span>To start, take a look at <a href="misc/Troubleshoot_C1.pdf" title="">this article&nbsp;</a> from Peek(65)&nbsp; Vol 6, issue 11.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>If you have a C1,C2, C4, C8, Superboard, or similar system, then check out the SAMS manuals (in the <a href="#Manuals" title="">Manuals</a> section below).&nbsp; </span><span>Also, Prof. Mark Csele has a nicely illustrated discussion of some specific debugging hints on <a href="http://192.197.62.35/staff/mcsele/OhioScientific.html" title="">his web page</a>.&nbsp; Also, check out the <a href="#Tips" title="">Tips and Tricks</a> section below.&nbsp; Post on the <a href="osiforum" title="">OSIweb forums</a></span><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Also, there are some online groups of vintage computer enthusiasts that don&#39;t specifically focus on OSI, but have accumulated wisdom about computer hardware, and probably more than a couple OSI enthusiasts.&nbsp; You may get some help on the classic computer mailing list (the cctalk list; check out <a href="http://www.classiccmp.org/" title="">http://www.classiccmp.org</a>, and also check out the Vintage Computer Federation  <a href="http://vcfed.org/forum/forum.php">forums</a>. You can also contact me directly by email, through the forums.</p>

    <p><font color="#000000">If you have an OSI, or OSI parts that you just don&#39;t feel motivated to repair or maintain, or OSI software or documentation that you would like to share with the world, then consider contributing it to the OSI archive.</font></p>

    <p><font color="#000000">If you want to just chat privately, you can email me at my osiweb.org address (dave, of course).&nbsp; Or register for the forums, and send a private message or email from there. </font></p>

    <h2><font color="#0000ff">WISH LIST:</font></h2>

    <p>I welcome contributions, especially of software and scanned (or paper) manuals, stories, tips, tricks, hacks, and other info.&nbsp; I am also interested in working and non-working OSI hardware, either photos or the real thing.&nbsp; I am particularly interested in any information on the following:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><font color="#0000ff" size="4">Documentation or software for the Generic Computer Products Color-Plus card </font></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Also, any information about, or working or non-working specimens of the following:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><font color="#0000ff" size="4">OSI 460Z card</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000ff" size="4">Any Mittendorf engineering hi-res kits, or similar Aardvark or other video mods for the C2/4 or for the C1/superboard </font></li>
    </ul>

    <p>I&#39;d love to hear from any other OSI&#39;ers.&nbsp; Please check out the <strong><a href="osiforum">Forums</a></strong> section of the archive, and post any comments, corrections, or memories for all of us to enjoy! You can also email me privately via the Forums section.</p>

    <h2>Credits:</h2>

    <p>Thanks to Steve Carroll, our local OSI dealer in Memphis Tennessee, who never complained about a couple of kids hanging out in his shop, and was something of a mentor and teacher to use younger OSI enthusiasts.&nbsp; I don&#39;t know where you are now, Steve, but thanks!</p>

    <p>Earl Morris contributed plenty of documentation and hardware to the effort.&nbsp; Earl also helped make much of that documentation (such as the journals) interesting by contributing high-mileage articles.</p>

    <p>Mark Spankus has contributed a heap of documentation, some of which I&#39;m still parsing, as well as expert discussion, including an excellent exposition on the floppy format, and the floppy image format for the emulator.&nbsp; Also, mark has a fantastic online catalog of OSI boards, with high quality photos, manuals, and schematics, of much value to anybody interested in OSI machines.&nbsp; He also developed the excellent Win-OSI emulator, which was adapted from Thomas Buescher&#39;s original version.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Douglas Scanned a great number of documents that would otherwise be impossible to find.&nbsp; These were passed on to me by Mark Spankus.</p>

    <p>Bill Dromgoole contributed Manuals and software for the 500 and 560Z boards</p>

    <p>Steve Gray contributed scans of the C1P Introductory Manual, TOSIE and Aardvark journals, D&amp;N MEM-CM9 and 8K RAM board manuals, and more.</p>

    <p>Graeme&nbsp; contributed CEGMON and HEXDOS users guides, and scans of several journals.</p>

    <p>Glitch contributed some hard-to-find hardware manuals/schematics, including the 525 dual port RAM board, and the 550 multi-serial board.</p>

    <p>Philip Lord contributed many disk images, documents, and programs; and many interesting forum posts.&nbsp; Glad to have you here Phil!</p>

    <p>Mike contributed numerous ROM images, software, and disk images, and scans, and also has contributed expertise on the forums.&nbsp; Much thanks to Mike!!</p>

    <p>Scott Larson for some interesting forum discussion, and for the high-res photos of the CxP board.</p>

    <p>Jeff Ferguson provided high quality scans of the invaluable SAMS manuals for the C1P, C4P, and C2/C3 systems, and meticulously stitched together the schematics to make them readable and usable.  Jeff also provided high-res photos of the rare OSI 541 high-res graphics add-on board, and went the extra mile to reverse engineer the schematics. Many thanks, Jeff!!</p>

    <p>Stephan M&uuml;hlstrasser ported cc65 to the C1P/Superboard II.&nbsp; Nice work!</p>

    <p>Erik Klein contributed the disks from which Philip created various floppy images.&nbsp; Thanks!</p>

    <p>Grant contributed multiple C1P 5.25&quot; disk images, as well as lots of interesting discussion on the forum.</p>

    <p> Pete Targett contributed scans of the OSI UK User Group Newsletter. Awesome, thanks!

    <p>I hope I didn&#39;t leave anybody out.&nbsp; If I did, please let me know and I will fix it!</p>
