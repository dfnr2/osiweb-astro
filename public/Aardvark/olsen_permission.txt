Subject: Re: Aardvark journal & OSI programs

I did not know that anyone remembered the old games. 

As for the Journal, it would be an honor to have some
of it survive on the web.  I have some of the original
artwork that I could scan and send to you.

The copyright status on the games is - for OSI and
TRS80  - probably expired. 

I recently submitted new copyright papers for pryamid,
mars, paranoids anonynous and Quest as I intend to use
the plots for the basis of a web gaming site that I am
putting together with Russian Programmers. 

You are welcome to put out free copies of the old code
so long as you send me a copy, do not make money from
it, and don't get so popular that you hurt the chance
of putting them on the internet (fat chance).
