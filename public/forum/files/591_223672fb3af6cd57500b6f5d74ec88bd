     INSTRUCTIONS FOR `SUPER STAR TREK`

1. WHEN YOU SEE \COMMAND ?\ PRINTED, ENTER ONE OF THE LEGAL
     COMMANDS (NAV,SRS,LRS,PHA,TOR,SHE,DAM,COM, OR XXX).
2. IF YOU TYPE IN AN ILLEGAL COMMAND, YOU`LL GET A SHORT
     LIST OF THE LEGAL COMMANDS PRINTED OUT.
3. SOME COMMANDS REQUIRE YOU TO ENTER DATA (FOR EXAMPLE, THE
     `NAV` COMMAND COMES BACK WITH `COURSE (1-9) ?`.) IF YOU
     TYPE IN ILLEGAL DATA (LIKE NEGATIVE NUMBERS), THAT
     COMMAND WILL BE ABORTED.

     THE GALAXY IS DIVIDED INTO AN 8X8 QUADRANT GRID.
EACH QUADRANT IS FURTHER DIVIDED INTO AN 8X8 SECTOR GRID.

     YOU WILL BE ASSIGNED A STARTING POINT SOMEWHERE IN THE
GALAXY TO BEGIN A TOUR OF DUTY AS COMMANDER OF THE STARSHIP
\ENTERPRISE\; YOUR MISSION: TO SEEK AND DESTROY THE FLEET
OF KLINGON WARSHIPS WHICH ARE MENACING THE
UNITED FEDERATION OF PLANETS.

     YOU HAVE THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS AVAILABLE TO YOU AS
CAPTAIN OF THE STARSHIP ENTERPRISE:

\NAV\ COMMAND = WARP ENGINE CONTROL.
     COURSE IS IN A CIRCULAR NUMERICAL      4  3  2
     VECTOR ARRANGEMENT AS SHOWN.            . . .
     INTEGER AND REAL VALUES MAY BE           ...
     USED.  (THUS COURSE 1.5 IS HALF-     5 ---*--- 1
     WAY BETWEEN 1 AND 2.)                    ...
     VALUES MAY APPROACH 9.0, WHICH          . . .
     ITSELF IS EQUIVALENT TO 1.0            6  7  8
     ONE WARP FACTOR IS THE SIZE OF
     ONE QUADRANT.  THEREFORE TO GET        COURSE
     FROM QUADRANT 6,5 TO 5,5 YOU WOULD
     USE COURSE 3, WARP FACTOR 1.

\SRS\ COMMAND = SHORT RANGE SENSOR SCAN
     SHOWS YOU A SCAN OF YOUR PRESENT QUADRANT.

     SYMBOLOGY ON YOUR SENSOR SCREEN IS AS FOLLOWS:
       <*> = YOUR STARSHIP`S POSITION
       +K+ = KLINGON BATTLE CRUISER
       >!< = FEDERATION STARBASE (FUEL/REPAIR/RE-ARM HERE!
        *  = STAR

     A CONDENSED STATUS REPORT WILL ALSO BE PRESENTED.

\LRS\ COMMAND = LONG RANGE SENSOR SCAN
     SHOWS CONDITIONS IN SPACE FOR ONE QUADRANT ON EACH SIDE
     OF THE ENTERPRISE, WHICH IS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SCAN.
     THE SCAN IS CODED IN THE FORM \###\, WHERE THE HUNDREDS
     DIGIT IS THE NUMBER OF KLINGONS, THE TENS DIGIT IS THE
     NUMBER OF STARBASES, AND THE UNITS DIGIT IS THE
     NUMBER OF STARS.

     EXAMPLE - 207 = 2 KLINGONS, NO STARBASES, & 7 STARS.

\PHA\ COMMAND = PHASER CONTROL
     ALLOWS YOU TO DESTROY THE KLINGON BATTLE CRUISERS BY
     ZAPPING THEM WITH SUITABLY LARGE UNITS OF ENERGY TO
     DEPLETE THEIR SHIELD POWER.  (REMEMBER, KLINGONS HAVE
     PHASERS TOO!)

\TOR\ COMMAND = PHOTON TORPEDO CONTROL.
     TORPEDO COURSE IS THE SAME AS USED IN WARP ENGINE
     CONTROL.  IF YOU HIT THE KLINGON, HE IS DESTROYED AND
     CANNOT FIRE BACK AT YOU.  IF YOU MISS, YOU ARE SUBJECT
     TO HIS PHASER FIRE.  IN EITHER CASE, YOU ARE ALSO
     SUBJECT TO THE PHASER FIRE OF ALL OTHER KLINGONS
     IN THE QUADRANT.

     THE LIBRARY-COMPUTER (\COM\ COMMAND) HAS AN OPTION TO
     COMPUTE TORPEDO TRAJECTORY FOR YOU (OPTION 2).

\SHE\ COMMAND = SHIELD CONTROL
     DEFINES THE NUMBER OF ENERGY UNITS ASSIGNED TO THE
     SHIELDS.  ENERGY IS TAKEN FROM TOTAL SHIP`S ENERGY.
     NOTE: THE STATUS DISPLAY TOTAL ENERGY INCLUDES SHIELDS.

\DAM\ COMMAND = DAMAGE CONTROL REPORT
     GIVES THE STATE OF REOAIR OF ALL DEVICES.  A NEGATIVE
     `STATE OF REPAIR` SHOWS THAT THE DEVICE IS
     TEMPORARILY DAMAGED.

\COM\ COMMAND = LIBRARY-COMPUTER.
     THE LIBRARY-COMPUTER CONTAINS SIX OPTIONS:
     OPTION 0 = CUMULATIVE GALACTIC RECORD.
       THIS OPTION SHOWS COMPUTER MEMORY OF THE RESULTS OF
       ALL PREVIOUS SHORT AND LONG RANGE SENSOR SCANS.
     OPTION 1 = STATUS REPORT.
       THIS OPTION SHOWS THE NUMBER OF KLINGONS, STARDATES,
       AND STARBASES REMAINING IN THE GAME.
     OPTION 2 = PHOTON TORPEDO DATA
       WHICH GIVES DIRECTIONS AND DISTANCES FROM THE
       ENTERPRISE TO ALL KLINGONS IN YOUR QUADRANT.
     OPTION 3 = STARBASE NAV DATA.
       THIS OPTION GIVES DIRECTION AND DISTANCE TO ANY
       STARBASE WITHIN YOUR QUADRANT.
     OPTION 4 = DIRECTION/DISTANCE CALCULATOR.
       THIS OPTION ALLOWS YOU TO ENTER COORDINATES FOR
       DIRECTION/DISTANCE CALCULATIONS.
     OPTION 5 = GALACTIC /REGION NAME/ MAP.
       THIS OPTION PRINTS THE NAMES OF THE SIXTEEN
       MAJOR GALACTIC REGIONS REFERRED TO IN THE GAME.
